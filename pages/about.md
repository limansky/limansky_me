subtitle: Who I am and what I'm doing

Hi! I'm Mike Limansky. I was born in 1982 in USSR, and I've been living in Russia.

I'm software developer with experience in different languages.  I spent lot of time
writing in C++, but now I'm mostly using Scala both for my work, and my hobby projects.

### Some of the projects:

* [MongoQuery](https://github.com/limansky/mongoquery). Scala library to provide string
  interpolators for MongoDB objects.  Supports multiple backend drivers.
* [TinyMount](https://github.com/limansky/tinymount). Qt-based tray mounter for Linux.
  It uses UDisks for mounting.
* [lift-salatauth](https://github.com/limansky/lift-salatauth). Plugin for the
  [Lift framework]() to support authorization via
  [Salat](https://github.com/novus/salat).
* [lift-validate](https://github.com/limansky/lift-validate). Plugin for the
  [Lift framework]() to add [jQuery validation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/) support.

### Not only programming

At my free time I like to play the guitar (both electric and acoustic) and the
bass guitar.  Also I'm interesting in the nature photography (most of the photos
on this site is taken by me).
