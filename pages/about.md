title: About me
---

Hi! I'm Mike Limansky. I was born in 1982 in USSR, and I've been living in Russia.

I'm software developer with experience in different languages.  I spent lot of time
writing in C++, but now I'm mostly using Scala both for my work, and my hobby projects.

### Some of the projects:

* [MongoQuery](https://github.com/limansky/mongoquery). Scala library to provide string
  interpolators for MongoDB objects.  Supports multiple backend drivers.
* [TinyMount](https://github.com/limansky/tinymount). Qt-based tray mounter for Linux.
  It uses UDisks for mounting.
* [lift-salatauth](https://github.com/limansky/lift-salatauth). Plugin for the
  [Lift framework]() to support authorization via
  [Salat](https://github.com/novus/salat).
* [lift-validate](https://github.com/limansky/lift-validate). Plugin for the
  [Lift framework]() to add [jQuery validation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/) support.
