I'm happy to announce the second release of
[BeanPurée](https://github.com/limansky/beanpuree) library.

The main goal of this release is to make `BeanConverter` more intelligent.
Previously, it required you to have the same type for the corresponding fields in a
bean and a product.  If there are Java number classes in your beans, it's possible you
don't want to use it in your Scala code.  Instead, you would like to use Options,
or you may know that these values are never null.

Now `BeanConverter` can do these kinds of transformations for you.

`JavaTypeMapper` type class was introduced to acheive that.  It provides
two-way conversions for the following cases:

 * Java number class to Scala type.  E.g. Integer to Int, or `java.math.BigDecimal`
   to `scala.math.BigDecimal`. If Java value is null it throws
   NullPointerException.
 * A class `T` to an `Option[T]`.  Wraps nullable to Option.
 * A class `T` for which an instance of `JavaTypeMapper` to class `U` is
   available to an `Option[U]`.  For example it is used to convert `Integer` to
   `Option[Int]`.
 * `HList` of the elements which can be mapped with `JavaTypeMapper`s, to HList
   of mapped values.

If you want to have a previous behavior from `BeanConverter` use
`StrictBeanConverter` class.
