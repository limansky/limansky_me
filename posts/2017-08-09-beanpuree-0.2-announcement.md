I'm happy to announce the second release of
[BeanPureé](https://github.com/limansky/beanpuree) library.

The main goal of this release is to make `BeanConverter` more intelligent.
Previously, it required to have the same type for the corresponding fields from
bean and product.  If there are Java number classes in your beans, possible
don't want to use it in your Scala code.  Instead, you would like to use Options,
or you may know what this values are always not null.

Now `BeanConverter` can do this kind of transformations for you.

To achieve that `JavaTypeMapper` type class was introduced.  It provides
two-way conversions for following cases:

 * Java number class to Scala type.  E.g. Integer to Int, or `java.math.BigDecimal`
   to `scala.math.BigDecimal`. If Java value is null it throws
   NullPointerException.
 * A class `T` to an `Option[T]`.  Wraps nullable to Option.
 * A class `T` for which an instance of `JavaTypeMapper` to class `U` is
   available to an `Option[U]`.  For example it is used to convert `Integer` to
   `Option[Int]`.
 * `HList` of the elements which can be mapped with `JavaTypeMapper`s, to HList
   of mapped values.

If you want to have an old behavior for the `BeanConverter` use
`StrictBeanConverter`.
