This is my first post in this blog, just to be sure that Hakyll is working.

Checking a syntax coloring for Haskell:

``` haskell
-- factorial
fac n = foldr (*) 1 [1..n]

main = do
  putStrLn "Hello, World"
```

<!-- MORE -->

And for Scala:

``` Scala
// Hello world
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
```

And that's all falks!
